## üöÄ How to Run the Bot

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer.
-   A Telegram account.
-   **A Telegram Bot Token.** You can get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

### 2. Installation

1.  **Download the Code**
    Copy the `telegram_bot_2025.py` file to your local directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install "python-telegram-bot[ext]" aiosqlite
    ```

### 3. Configuration

1.  **Set Your Bot Token**
    The most recommended way is to use an environment variable.

    -   **On Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        export TELEGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
        ```
    -   **On Windows (CMD):**
        ```bash
        set TELEGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
        ```
    -   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        $env:TELEGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
        ```

    *Alternative (not recommended for production):* You can directly change the following line of code in the `.py` file:
    ```python
    token = os.getenv("TELEGRAM_TOKEN", "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE")
    ```

### 4. Run the Bot

After all dependencies are installed and the token is set, run the bot with the command:
```bash
python your_bot_file.py
```

Your bot is now active and ready to receive messages on Telegram!
